# vsh [TESTING PHASE, DO NOT USE]
## pre-installation
Do not run the script as root/sudo! Only use sudo when the script itself prompts you to.

This script is intended for use on a fresh and minimal installation of Void Linux, before the ```~/.config``` and ```~/Pictures``` directories are created.

Make sure that the ```vsh``` directory is cloned under the ```~``` directory, or bad stuff might happen.
### To run the script:
```sh
~/vsh/v.sh
```

Custom args can be used when prompted with "Hit enter to proceed..."

Currently supported args:
```noconf``` skips backup creation and config moving

More to come (maybe)
