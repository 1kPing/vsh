# vsh
## pre-installation
Do not run the script as root/sudo! Only use sudo when the script itself prompts you to.

This script is intended for use on a fresh and minimal installation of Void Linux, before the ```~/.config``` and ```~/Pictures``` directories are created.

Make sure that the ```vsh``` directory is cloned under the ```~``` directory, or bad stuff might happen.
### To run the script:
```sh
~/vsh/v.sh
```
