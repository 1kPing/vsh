# vsh
## pre-installation
Do not run the script as root/sudo! Only use sudo when the script itself prompts you to.

This script is intended for use on a fresh and minimal installation of Void Linux, before the ```~/.config``` and ```~/Pictures``` directories are created.

Make sure you have dash installed to be able to run this.
```sh
sudo xbps-install -S dash
```
### To run the script:
```sh
~/vsh/v.sh
```
